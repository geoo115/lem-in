## An Ant Movement Optimization:

## Introduction:

We have been tasked with creating a program that optimizes the movement of ants in a graph-based environment. The program should read input data from a file, construct a graph, find optimal paths for ants to move through the graph, allocate ants to paths, and output the movement of ants in a human-readable format.

## Requirements:

- Read Input:

Read input data from a specified file.
The input data includes:
The number of ants.
The names of start and end rooms.
A list of rooms with their coordinates.
A list of links between rooms.

- Graph Construction:

Construct a graph representation from the provided input data.
Each room has a unique name and coordinates (X, Y).
Rooms are connected by links.
Optimal Path Finding:

Implement a path-finding algorithm to find all possible paths between the start and end rooms.
Determine the optimal path based on the number of ants and path lengths.

- Ant Allocation:

Allocate ants to paths in a way that minimizes the total travel time.
Each ant should traverse one path from start to end.

- Movement Output:

Print the movement of ants along the optimal paths.
Implement two output options:
Print ants' movements over time steps.
Print ants' migration in a single step.

- Code Organization:

Organize the code into modular functions with clear responsibilities.
Use meaningful variable and function names.
Implement error handling and informative error messages.

- Testing and Validation:

Implement unit tests to validate the functionality of your functions.
Provide example input files and expected output for testing purposes.

## Approach:

BSF

## Tools:

## Setup:

Input Format:

```
<number_of_ants>
<start_room_name>
<end_room_name>
<room_name_1> <x_coordinate> <y_coordinate>
<room_name_2> <x_coordinate> <y_coordinate>
...
<link_start_room_name_1>-<link_end_room_name_1>
<link_start_room_name_2>-<link_end_room_name_2>
...
```

Output Format:

Ant movements should be printed in a human-readable format.
For each time step, print the room each ant is in.
The output format should include either steps or a single migration.
Example Input:

```
5
##start
##end
room1 0 0
room2 1 0
room3 1 1
start-room1
room1-room2
room2-room3
room3-end
Example Output:
(Time steps format)

L1-start L2-start L3-start L4-start L5-start
L1-room1 L2-room1 L3-room1 L4-room1 L5-room1
L1-room2 L2-room2 L3-room2 L4-room2 L5-room2
L1-room3 L2-room3 L3-room3 L4-room3 L5-room3
L1-end L2-end L3-end L4-end L5-end
```
